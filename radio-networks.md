# Radio Network Communications

### RAT
A Radio Access Technology or (RAT) is the underlying physical connection method for a radio based communication network. Many modern mobile phones support several 
RATs in one device such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GSM, UMTS, LTE or 5G NR. 

### 5G NR (New Radio)
Is a new radio access technology (RAT) developed by 3GPP for the 5G (fifth generation) mobile network. It was designed to be the global standard for the air interface 
of 5G networks.

### LTE
Long-Term Evolution (**LTE**) is a standard for wireless broadband communication for mobile devices and data terminals, based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies.
It increases the capacity and speed using a different radio interface together with core network improvements. LTE is the upgrade path for carriers with both
GSM/UMTS networks and CDMA2000 networks. The different LTE frequencies and bands used in different countries mean that only multi-band phones are able to use LTE in 
all countries where it is supported.
