# Networking Concepts


* NaaS
Referring to Network as a Service, so the description of the service provided to solve any kind of application regarding networking.

* Edge Computing
Faster wireless technologies allow for computational gravitational center for moving from centralized through decentralized and localized.

* Virtual Infrastructure Manager
Software to Virtually manage network infra, such as Open Stack.

* WiFi Access Point

* RAN
The radio access network (RAN) has been in use since the beginning of cellular technology and has evolved through the generations of mobile communications (1G through 5G).

* NAT
Network Access Translation

* Hairpinning
In network computing, hairpinning describes a communication between two hosts behind the same NAT device using their mapped endpoint. Because not all NAT devices support this communication configuration, applications must be aware of it. Hairpinning is where a machine on the LAN is able to access another machine on the LAN via the external IP address of the LAN/router.

* backhaul
* A-record
* CNAME
* Domain
* DNS

* SMTP
Protocol to sent emails over the web

* Sockets
A network socket is an internal endpoint for sending or receiving data within a node on a computer network. Concretely, it is a representation of this endpoint in networking software (protocol stack), such as an entry in a table (listing communication protocol, destination, status, etc.), and is a form of system resource. 

* SOAP
SOAP (abbreviation for `Simple Object Access Protocol`) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality, verbosity and independence. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.   
SOAP has three major characteristics:
    1. extensibility (security and WS-Addressing are among the extensions under development)  
    2. neutrality (SOAP can operate over any protocol such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP, UDP)
    3. independence (SOAP allows for any programming model)

* CORBA
The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a standard defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) designed to facilitate the communication of systems that are deployed on diverse platforms. CORBA enables collaboration between systems on different operating systems, programming languages, and computing hardware. CORBA uses an object-oriented model although the systems that use the CORBA do not have to be object-oriented. CORBA is an example of the distributed object paradigm.


* REST
Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of Web services, such as SOAP Web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.
